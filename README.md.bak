# CV-Template
This is a latex template for building a single-page CV.
You can be found the origin version in http://www.latexstudio.net/ .

I modify some codes in .cls file to make it to be compatible for Chinese-lang CV. 
Besides, I modify template for my cv to look native.

Extra Functions:
1. a profile picture can be display in the top-left corner.
2. A personal site has been replace by IT boys' social site Github!
3. The language field in the sidebar has filled by text, instead of a picture dut to its big size.
4. I have use a new construction of table cell for new content block without 'location' field, 
	called 'twentyitem', but it was commented. Maybe you will use it for more compact typography.

All these places differ from the origin version have been comment by "by Yan Zheng". 
You can use search tool/command in your text editor to find them.

A demo tex file can guide to use this template. 
There are some mistakes in it, if you found, please revise them.

Thank you for attention. 
Enjoy to use for your Chinese single-page CV. 
Hope for you to meet a nice job!
